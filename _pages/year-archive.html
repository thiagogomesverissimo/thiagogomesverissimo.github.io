  Welcome to my personal blog. Here, you'll find a bunch of tutorials that I've carefully put together based on my daily experiences. 
  The whole point of this blog is to share my experiences and discoveries, while also serving as a place to organize my public life. Here, you'll find a showcase of my academic work, professional endeavors, tutorials, contributions to open/free softwares, and talks.
